**Language Detection using Trigram Language Modeling**

This project focuses on implementing language detection using trigram language modeling. The goal is to develop a Python program that performs the following tasks:

-Build a trigram language model over characters: The program will read in a text file, collect counts for all character 3-grams, estimate probabilities, and write out the model to a file.

-Generate random output based on a provided model: The program will read in a pre-existing model from a file and generate random output using that model.

-Compute the perplexity of a test document: The program will read in a test document and calculate its perplexity using one of the language models.

***Motivation***
The motivation behind this assignment is to practice important skills in natural language processing (NLP) and gain experience working with language data. By completing this project, I aim to demonstrate the following abilities:

Understanding concepts and challenges related to language modeling and working with real language data.
Implementing a basic Python program to perform language detection using trigram language models.
Presenting clear explanations and justifications for decisions made during the implementation process.
Describing and interpreting obtained results effectively.


***The project involves the following main components:***

Building the Trigram Language Model:

Reading a text file and collecting counts for all character 3-grams.
Estimating probabilities based on the collected counts.
Writing the trigram language model to a file for later use.
Generating Random Output:

Reading a pre-existing trigram language model from a file.
Utilizing the model to generate random output, simulating text in a similar style to the training data.
Computing Perplexity:

Reading a test document for language evaluation.
Using one of the language models to calculate the perplexity of the test document.


Instructions
To run the program, please follow these steps:

Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages.
Ensure that the input text file and language model files are available in the correct directories.
Execute the main Python file, specifying the desired task to be performed.
View the generated output or computed perplexity as per the chosen task.
